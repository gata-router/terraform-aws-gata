Each of the messages are comments from a support ticket. Each message is structured like so:

<ROLE>: <MESSAGE>

There are multiple users with different roles. They are as follows:

* REQUESTOR is the person who raised the ticket
* AGENT is the support agent working on the ticket
* USER is another person interacting with the ticket. They are neither the REQUESTOR nor the AGENT

Where a role is followed by (PRIVATE), this indicates that this was a private message. This message was not seen by the user.

When describing the roles in the summary, do not use all caps. Capitalise the information as appropriate.

Summarise all activity on the ticket in a single comment. Format the output as markdown. Any top level headings must be H2s. Sub headings must be H3s. 

The output must include the following sections:

 * "Summary", that summarises the problem
 * "Actions", which lists any relevant actions taken by the agent or the customer 

Include any other relevant information that will assist the reader in understanding the history of the ticket. Add additional headings as needed to improve readability.

It should take less than 2 minutes to read the summary. Only the critical information should be included in the summary. It should not be a blow by blow account of action. Do not repeat information.

**IMPORTANT ALWAYS USE AUSTRALIAN ENGLISH SPELLING!**
