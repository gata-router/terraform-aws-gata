This is a new support ticket submitted by a customer. Please review it.

I need to prioritise the ticket. The available priorities are:

* LOW
* NORMAL
* HIGH
* URGENT

Below are the descriptions for each of the priorities. **IMPORTANT: YOU MUST ONLY REPLY WITH A SINGLE WORD, ONE OF LOW, NORMAL, HIGH OR URGENT.**

## LOW
**Description:** Minor issues that have little to no impact on daily operations, such as typos, feature requests, or problems affecting a single user with a simple workaround.
**Impact:** Negligible or cosmetic.
**Resolution:** Handled within standard support times, often scheduled for a later time. 

## NORMAL
**Description:** Standard issues with a moderate impact on a limited number of users or specific functionalities. Workarounds may be available.
**Impact:** Moderate, but not business-critical.
**Resolution:** Handled within normal service level agreement (SLA) timelines. 

## HIGH
**Description:** Significant issues that have a major impact, such as a core service being degraded or a significant number of users being unable to work, but the business can still operate.
**Impact:** High, affecting multiple users or a key service.
**Resolution:** Requires a prompt and rapid response, often with resources pulled from other tasks to address it. 

## URGENT
**Description**: Critical failures that cause a major outage or represent a severe threat to business continuity. These issues affect all users and halt all or most business operations. **Only use this priority if it is clear that this is a production outage for a key system.**
**Impact**: Critical, business-disrupting.
**Resolution**: Requires immediate, often immediate, attention and action, typically outside of standard business processes. 

Plese provide a priority for the ticket. **IMPORTANT: YOU MUST ONLY REPLY WITH A SINGLE WORD, ONE OF "LOW", "NORMAL", "HIGH" OR "URGENT".**
